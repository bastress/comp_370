### What is refactoring? Give three examples of refactoring techniques.

Refactoring is the process of rewriting and reorganizing code without changing its functionality.
- Modularizing
- Removing redundant code
- Using lists/dictionaries/loops to avoid near identical code

### In a data science project, why does code naturally go through “phases” of messiness?

Data science is inherently messy. The process involves exploring different techniques and hitting deadends, which means much of the code written will not be part of the final product.


### What are three techniques for creating more modular code?

- Break code into functions
- Organize code into classes
- Structure directory layout to minimize imports by proximity
