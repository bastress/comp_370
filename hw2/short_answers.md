### Give four reasons why a cloud machine is better than a laptop for data science work at scale.
- Can do powerful operations with a weak internet connection
- Easily scalable resources
- Don't have to manage the hardware
- Cloud servers maximize uptime, no worries of laptop closing or dying

### List out the stages in the data science process and define each (in 1 sentence)
- Question definition: Determining the scope of the project through continual refinement of the question and communication with stakeholders.
- Data collection: Obtaining and arranging data so it can be worked with, including deciding what to collect, identifying anomalies, correcting issues, and standardizing structure.
- Data annotation: applying/infering features that will be used for analysis.
- Data analysis: The creation of statistical models and visualizations using existing methods and existing, (relatively) clean, quantitative data.
- Interpretation: Finding the actionable, meaningful, credible insight from the quantitative results of analysis.
- Communication: Preparing findings to be communicated, tell a story that effectively and credibly delivers the result. 

### What is the difference between data analytics and data science?
Data analytics focuses on measuring things to gain concrete new insight, whereas data science focuses on measuring things that haven't been measured before.

### Give an example of how a loop can occur in the data science process.
The data science process is iterative. For example, during the data collection phase of a project analyzing the size of apples, you might realize there are stark differences based on the geographic region in which they are grown. This would send you back to the question definition stage where you check in with the stakeholders about the geographical scope of the problem.
