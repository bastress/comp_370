##### Q1: A hospital wants to know how its medication stocks line up with patient demand in the hospital. Develop a use case that motivates this question by identifying a persona (presumably someone who works at the hospital) and a concrete activity that will make use of this information. Of course, we don’t have access to the hospital in question – so you’ll be developing your own use case. So there are many credible answers.

The purchasing manager of a hospital would certainly find value in the answer to this question. Given they are in charge of maintaining the medication supplies, then knowing whether they need to be purchasing more or less is vital. If they find they are overstocking compared to patient demand, perhaps needing to dispose of excess supplies at times, then having evidence-based reasoning to scale back supply could save the hospital money. If on the other hand they are understocked compared to demand, this information could be of aid to the patients at the hospital, even increasing the effectiveness of the hospital's care.


##### Q2: Why does the real world impact the complexity of code we write in a data science project?

- Messy and inconsistent data is extremely common in the real world, requiring extra work to parse and handle edge cases.
- Often the people writing the code are not the ones defining the scope of the project. Stakeholders may request information that is much harder to obtain than it might seem from a non-technical standpoint.
- Dealing with extremely large and constantly changing data in the real world requires finding efficiencies wherever possible which can lead to complex code.
