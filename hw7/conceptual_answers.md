### Why is the difference between found and designed data?

Found data is data that was created for another purposes, whereas designed data was created specifically for the project, such as surveys or experimental data.

### What are the two primary challenges that necessitate sampling when collecting data?

- Data can be extremely LARGE. Therefore, selecting a subset of the data can improve analysis speeds with similar results.
- Data is biased, and so understanding that bias is a necessity. Sampling can ensure that the data collected will reflect the question being asked.

### Why are website owners more likely to be upset about collecting data using scrapers than using APIs?

When a company creates an API, they are intentionally giving out their data. They have explicit control over who is using it and how frequently. On the other hand, web scraping could be used in ways they did't want or hadn't anticipated. The permissions are more gray.
