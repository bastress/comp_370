# McGill/Concordia Subreddit Taxonomy Guide

## Motivation

This taxonomy was built for the purpose of classifying the topics of posts to the McGill and Concordia subreddits. The classifications are made solely based off the titles of the posts. The taxonomy seeks to provide a comprehensive coverage of categories for accurate and reproducible analysis.

## Categories

#### Housing:
Definition: Posts relating to housing, whether that be university residences, apartments, etc.

Examples:
- "Best Concordia Residence"
- "Short term student housing"

Edge Cases:
- "New Rez washing machines not working." IN. Seems like it could be labeled university services, but it is residence related.
- "Warning: Burglaries in area." OUT. Relates to housing, but this better fits PSA.

#### Courses:
Definition: Anything related to courses offered at the university. This includes people asking for class recommendations or posts mentioning a specific course code.

Examples:
- "Bioc 212"
- "Easiest eng courses?"

Edge Cases:
- "Studying tips for comp 252 final?" OUT. Despite mentioning course code, this is specifically referencing an exam and should be labeled exam.
- "Am I cooked if I‚Äôm about to graduate but remembers nothing from my classes?" IN. This one is tricky, but classes are mentioned more clearly than other categories.

#### Fun:
Definition: Anything silly, partying related, or creative/upbeat and outside other categories.

Examples:
- "Halloween Costume Help"
- "Best places to eat"

Edge Cases:
- "Custom hoodies" IN. Little to go off of, but is a creative pursuit and unrelated to other categories.
- "Most fun major?" OUT. Mentions fun, but this should be classified as programs.

#### Grades:
Definition: Anything grade related, 

Examples:
- "Requesting a regrade"
- "Curving grades at Concordia"

Edge Cases:
- "Math 205 minimum grade" IN. Mentions course code, but grades takes precedent
- "McGill announces new grading system" OUT. This is an announcement of news and should be PSA.

#### Programs:
Definition: Relating to university programs such as the degree level (bachelor's, master's, etc.) or major/minor choices.

Examples:
- "Can I transfer within my faculty in my second semester?"
- "Honours Psych"

Edge Cases:
- "Easiest Electives for Master of Applied Computer Science?" OUT. Should be courses.
- "Programs/classes with Hot Girls" IN. Programs is stated first.

#### PSA:
Definition: Public Service Announcements. This could be warnings of events occurring on campus or in the city, news article headlines, anything aimed at informing a broader audience.

Examples:
- "Beware of job scam"
- "Quebec puts permanent immigration on hold"

Edge Cases:
- "Abnormal squirrels üêøÔ∏è" IN. Based solely on the title, it doesn't quite fit criteria for fun, but could be a warning to public.
- "I farted really hard in class and the lights flickered" OUT. This one is labeled fun since it is silly and likely not a genuine warning about the lights.

#### University Services:
Definition: Posts relating to services provided by the university, including access to and locations of buildings, school events, library services, etc.

Examples:
- "opus card renewal as a full time student for one semester"
- "CSU healthcare clinique"

Edge Cases:
- "ENCS Computers" IN. While ENCS is a program, the post title refers to computers provided by the school.
- "Best club offered by McGill" OUT. Clubs are an extracurricular activity.

#### Extracurriculars:
Definition: Posts relating to clubs, student societies, intramural or varsity sports, job/internship search, school adjacent free time activities, etc.

Examples:
- "Coop"
- "McGill Balkan Society"

Edge Cases:
- "Looking For A French Partner!" IN. The goal is to study french.
- "Study group for comp 208" OUT. This is directly tied to a course and should be labeled courses.
