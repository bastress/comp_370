## Error Assessment

Based on the areas where the annotators disagreed, it's clear that there was uncertainty around posts that aren't directly related to the university. Additionally, when a post mentions two categories, such as "midterm grades", there was some confusion as to which category it'd fall in. Lastly, some posts have short titles that don't necessarily make clear what the post is about, such as "C-edge orientation", leading to further inconsistency.
