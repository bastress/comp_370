### When dealing with human coded data, it can be tempting to throw out data items that did not have perfect or majority agreement. Why is this a bad practice?

This practice can introduce unwanted biases in the data. If the human coded data only contains the clear cut cases, then the results of data analysis will not match the true reality and won't answer the project's question. Additionally, throwing out annoying data skips out on the process of revising the typology which can improve the project and lead to valuable insight.


### Consider the following analysis tasks. Rank them by the degree to which they are fishing expeditions. Explain your ranking.

#### My Ranking:
1. Identify the kinds of locations where people go on St. Laurent.
2. Identify the dietary preferences of people who shop on St. Laurent.
3. Measure the correlation between outside temperature and the amount of foot traffic on St. Laurent on a Saturday night.

The 1st task is extremely open-ended and is fishing for some kind of interesting result without any concrete idea of what that would be. The 2nd task has more focus, looking to connect dietary preference with shopping location, but does not specify in what way to investigate that relationship which would lead to fishing for a connection. The 3rd task is measurable and specific, and does not leave room for doubt as to what an expected outcome would look like.


### For the most extreme fishing expedition identified, explain how more work in the data annotation phase would avoid/limit the open-ness of the question.

Developing a comprehensive typology in the annotation phase that fits the data collected would force the scope of the project to narrow in a particular element. For instance with task 1, let's say the data consisted of the results of a survey of montreal residents stating the place on St. Laurent they most frequently visit. The survey data could then be categorized by type of establishment, age of the business, area of St. Laurent it's located on, etc. Developing a comprehensive typology requires honing in on one of these subjects.


### Diagram and explain how the desire to use automated data annotation can lead to a secondary data science project.

Automated annotation often requires developing a new system to do the annotating; finding one that is readily available and established is rare. The process of building this system follows the steps of the data science process all on its own. The process could look like:
- (Question Definition) How accurate is my annotator?
- (Data Collection) Collect testing data
- (Data Annotation) Perform human annotation on data
- (Data Analysis) Run annotator and compare to human annotation
- (Interpretation) Determine accuracy from results
- (Communication) Document effectiveness and use cases for future utility


### For each question below, identify the type of answer required (definition, process, or motivation) and give a precise answer for a young child audience (say somewhere around 5-6 years old).

#### What is an airplane?
(Definition) An airplane is a vehicle that can travel high in the sky at fast speeds and can carry people and cargo.

#### Why do we have stoplights?
(Motivation) Stoplights are meant to direct traffic by indicating to drivers whether it is their turn to go or not, which ensures that people driving in different directions don't crash in to each other and that everyone can get to their destinations.

#### When is it appropriate to yell “Fire” in a crowded room?
(Definition) The only time it is appropriate to yell "fire" in a crowded room is when there is an actual fire that could be a danger to people in the vicinity.

#### How do you eat an apple?
(Process)
- Grab the apple
- Raise the apple to your mouth and bite into the non-stem portion
- chew carefully and swallow
- repeat the last two steps until only the core and stem remain
- dispose of the remains
